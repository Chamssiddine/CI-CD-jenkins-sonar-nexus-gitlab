# DevOps-First-Project
the project aime to create a CI/CD platform hosted on container using docker compose where we clone our source code which is
generated by JHipster from Gitlab server Hosted on our machine, we pass the code through quality Gates using SonarQube
afterward we Build and test the application using NPM for the front end and Maven for back-end afterward we Dockerize the
application and create our docker image finally we push the artifact and docker image to Nexus Repository for Version Control
and if our application is ready we deploy it and launch it inside docker container using docker-compose file.

## Purpose:
we will be using 
- gitlab
- jenkins
- Maven
- Docker & Docker-compose
- SonarQube
- Nexus Sonatype
- Jhipster

## Walkthrough

Launch all the container with docker-compose.

Configure Jenkins, Gitlab, SonarQube, NexusSonatype.

Create Jenkinsfile which container the stages of our pipeline.

Create Triggers.

Test the whole CI/CD pipeline.

## Launch the Containers

Clone the repo, and go to docker-compose folder and type

 `$ sudo docker-compose up -d`

to view the logs don't use the tag -d and don't close the terminal or the containers will be terminating

## Configuration

- You can install the plugins in jenkins using the script by going to script folder and type

 `$ bash installplugins.bash`

// if there is a problem with installing some plugins let me know or you can install it manually in jenkins

- To get all the initial passwords go to the script folder and type 

 `$ bash initialpasswords.bash`

NOTE: After 24 hours the passwords will be gone so you can store them somewhere.

- Change the login password for each of them and some of them will prompt to change it after putting the initial user and password.

- Integrate Gitlab and Nexus and Sonar with jenkins you can follow the pdf in my repo.

Note: there are images inside img folder of the screenshots on how, free to check them.

## Jenkins file

how I did it is create one Jenkins file for each Pipeline I need 
 - Continuous Integration Pipeline
 - Daily Pipeline
 - Continuous Deployment Pipeline
 
But we will create a single Jenkins file to make it simpler.

## creating the pipeline

 * Go to the main dashboard -> new item -> pipeline 

 * You can configure triggers but I won't dive into it 

 * Copy the jenkins file text (insde jenkinsfile folder) in the section
 NOTE: You need to change the credentials for clone the repo and the repo link and you need the jhipster app in your gitrepo you will find it in mainapp-main

 * Apply and save.

## Test the whole CI/CD pipeline.

 * click on build Now adn you're done

 IMPORTANT: If there is something missing let me know or something not working for you.
 
 and I will provide step by step PDF on the parts I didn't mention
