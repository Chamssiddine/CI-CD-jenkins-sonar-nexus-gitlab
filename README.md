# CI/CD Pipeline
To streamline the software development process, I created a sufficient CI/CD pipeline by leveraging the capabilities of Docker Compose. Using Docker Compose, I was able to launch containers for various tools such as Jenkins, Nexus, SonarQube}, and GitLab. This allowed me to automate the entire pipeline, from building and testing the code (Generated by Jhipster Angular + Springboot) to deploying it to the production environment.

## Purpose:
we will be using 
- gitlab
- jenkins
- Maven
- Docker & Docker-compose
- SonarQube
- Nexus Sonatype
- Jhipster

## Walkthrough

Launch all the container with docker-compose.

Configure Jenkins, Gitlab, SonarQube, NexusSonatype.

Create Jenkinsfile which container the stages of our pipeline.

Create Triggers.

Test the whole CI/CD pipeline.

## Launch the Containers

Clone the repo, and go to docker-compose folder and type

 `$ sudo docker-compose up -d`

to view the logs don't use the tag -d and don't close the terminal or the containers will be terminating

## Configuration

- You can install the plugins in jenkins using the script by going to script folder and type

 `$ bash installplugins.bash`

// if there is a problem with installing some plugins let me know or you can install it manually in jenkins

- To get all the initial passwords go to the script folder and type 

 `$ bash initialpasswords.bash`

NOTE: After 24 hours the passwords will be gone so you can store them somewhere.

- Change the login password for each of them and some of them will prompt to change it after putting the initial user and password.

- Integrate Gitlab and Nexus and Sonar with jenkins you can follow the pdf in my repo.

Note: there are images inside img folder of the screenshots on how, free to check them.

## Jenkins file

how I did it is create one Jenkins file for each Pipeline I need 
 - Continuous Integration Pipeline
 - Daily Pipeline
 - Continuous Deployment Pipeline
 
But we will create a single Jenkins file to make it simpler.

## creating the pipeline

 * Go to the main dashboard -> new item -> pipeline 

 * You can configure triggers but I won't dive into it 

 * Copy the jenkins file text (insde jenkinsfile folder) in the section
 NOTE: You need to change the credentials for clone the repo and the repo link and you need the jhipster app in your gitrepo you will find it in mainapp-main

 * Apply and save.

## Test the whole CI/CD pipeline.

 * click on build Now adn you're done

 IMPORTANT: If there is something missing let me know or something not working for you.
 
 and I will provide step by step PDF on the parts I didn't mention
